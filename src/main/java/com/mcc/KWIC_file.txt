But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and


of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
consequences that are extremely painful.
